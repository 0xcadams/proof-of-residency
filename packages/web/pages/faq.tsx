          Proof of Residency is a permissionless {'"proof of personhood"'} protocol - we send
          physical mail with a secret phrase and use a <strong>commit-reveal scheme</strong> to
          prove that the recipient is human and resides at the provided address. The physical
          address is kept private and names are not requested. The subsequently minted ERC-721

          Minting can be performed by first requesting a Proof of Residency letter to your physical
          address. Letters are mailed via USPS First Class mail with a typical delivery time of 4 to
          6 business days for US addresses and international mailings with an additional 5 to 7
          days. Once the letter is received, the unique mnemonic you receive can be used to mint a
          token for your country.

          cover operational costs.
