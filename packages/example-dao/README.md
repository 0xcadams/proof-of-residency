## Overview

This is a demo project for how a DAO can use the Proof of Residency contracts to determine whether a contributor is verified as a human. There is only one contract and one test - the Proof of Residency contract is mocked using Waffle.

### Details

This stack uses [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) to orchestrate tasks and [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) for all Ethereum interactions and testing. There are also shared types between the tests and smart contract layer using [Typechain](https://github.com/dethcrypto/TypeChain).
