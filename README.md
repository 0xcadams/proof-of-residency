Proof of Residency is an NFT design project based on maps, built with Solidity/Typescript. This stack uses [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) to orchestrate tasks and [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) for all Ethereum interactions and testing. There are also shared types between the tests and smart contract layer using [Typechain](https://github.com/dethcrypto/TypeChain).
